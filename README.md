# COVID-19 Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


# Introduction:

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a COVID-19 dataset to gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic. The analysis examines various metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant factors across different countries and regions.

# Dataset Description:

Country/Region: The country or region where the data was recorded.

Confirmed: Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Deaths: Total number of deaths due to COVID-19.

Recovered: Total number of recoveries from COVID-19.

Active: Total number of active COVID-19 cases.

New cases: Number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases.

New deaths: Number of new deaths due to COVID-19.

New recovered: Number of new recoveries from COVID-19.

Deaths / 100 Cases: Number of deaths per 100 confirmed cases.

Recovered / 100 Cases: Number of recoveries per 100 confirmed cases.

Deaths / 100 Recovered: Number of deaths per 100 recoveries.

Confirmed last week: Number of confirmed cases in the previous week.

1 week change: Change in the number of confirmed cases over the past week.

1 week % increase: Percentage increase in confirmed cases over the past week.

WHO Region: World Health Organization (WHO) region classification.




# Key Findings:

Total Cases and Deaths: Highlighting countries with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths.

Recovery Rates: Analysis of recovery rates across different regions.


# Regional Analysis:

WHO Regions: Comparison of COVID-19 statistics by WHO regions.

Trends Over Time: Analysis of changes in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.


# Death and Recovery Ratios:

Deaths per 100 Cases: Analysis of the fatality rate per 100 confirmed cases.

Recovered per 100 Cases: Examination of recovery rates per 100 confirmed cases.

Deaths per 100 Recovered: Evaluation of the number of deaths per 100 recoveries.


# Visualizations:

The EDA includes various visualizations such as:

Line Plots: To show trends over time for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Bar Charts: To compare the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and regions.

Heatmaps: To visualize the severity and spread of COVID-19 across different geographical areas.

Box Plots: To identify outliers and understand the distribution of data.


# Conclusion:

The EDA provides a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact globally and regionally. By examining various metrics and identifying key trends, the analysis helps in 
understanding the spread, severity, and recovery patterns of the virus. This information can be valuable for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers in formulating 
strategies to combat the pandemic effectively.
